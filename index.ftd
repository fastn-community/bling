"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live
 on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your
 body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the
 way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced."
